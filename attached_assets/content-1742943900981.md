- Upload attachment to Airtable

## How to upload attachments to Airtable using API

Airtable supports columns of
type [_Attachment_](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/field-model#multipleattachment) which can contain
arbitrary file uploads. These may include an image file (JPG or
PNG or GIF) or a zip file or just about anything at all. While
Airtable provides ways to upload a file using their GUI, the
information on how to do that via an external program or script
is not clear. This article attempts to address this issue.

We use an example Airtable base _Expense Trackin_ to
demonstrate the code. This sample base is provided by Airtable
as an example. This base includes a single table
called _Receipt Log_. It contains two _Attachment_
fields called _Item Photo_ and _Receipt Photo_ along
with a bunch of other fields. We will now create a record with
uploads for these attachment fields.

### Authentication

To be able to read or create records in an Airtable, you need
to authenticate yourself with the accounnt. Airtable supports
two types of authentication:

- Personal access token is used to grant access to your
account to another person or entity.
- Oauth authentication is used when you need to authorize
another application to perform actions on your behalf.

For our example, we will use
a [Personal access token](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) to make API
calls. Making API calls using Oauth authentication is
substantially the same.

- Navigate to [the personal access tokens\\
page](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) and click on _Create token_![](https://teramine.com/assets/pagemedia/airtable-upload-attachment/create-token.png)
- On the _Create token_ page, enter a name for the token
for your identification. Next choose the following scopes
which allow read and write access to the records:


1. `data.records:read` allows reading records from
      your airtable.
2. `data.records:write` allows your script to
      write one or more records.
3. `schema.bases:read` allows you to read the
      structure of your table.

You will also need to grant access to at least
one _Base_. Here we have allowed access to the _Expense_
_Tracking_ base. Finally click the _Create token_
button to create the token.
![](https://teramine.com/assets/pagemedia/airtable-upload-attachment/create-token-form.png)
- A box will appear with the token for your program to
use. Copy the token and store it in a safe place. We will use
this later to invoke Airtable API. Do not expose the token to
the public as we have done here. This is just an example and
we have revoked the token shown so it won't work.
![](https://teramine.com/assets/pagemedia/airtable-upload-attachment/token.png)

### Our first API call

Now that we have our API token, let us make our first API
call to Airtable. The call we are making lists the available
bases. Here is what it looks like.

```python
import requests, json

API_TOKEN = '-- your api token here --'

resp = requests.get('https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases',
                    headers = {
                        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_TOKEN}'
                    })
resp.raise_for_status()
print(resp.json())
```

Copy

Response received to the call shows the bases available with
the API key.

```json
{
  "bases": [\
    {\
      "id": "appLNi67byiXQBQs1",\
      "name": "Expense Tracking",\
      "permissionLevel": "create"\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Copy

And here is how to list the tables available in the base
shown above.

```python
baseId = bases["bases"][0]["id"]
url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{baseId}/tables'
resp = requests.get(url, headers={
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_TOKEN}'
})
resp.raise_for_status()
print(json.dumps(resp.json(), indent=2))
```

Copy

The response to the table listing API call is shown below
(truncated):

```json
{                                                                                                                                                                 [106/46990]
  "tables": [\
    {\
      "id": "tblp43jU9lsRooZaX",\
      "name": "Receipt Log",\
      "primaryFieldId": "fldgmWjEk2HratckK",\
      "fields": [\
        {\
          "type": "singleLineText",\
          "id": "fldgmWjEk2HratckK",\
          "name": "Short Description"\
        },\
        {\
          "type": "multipleAttachments",\
          "options": {\
            "isReversed": false\
          },\
          "id": "fldy7SE7OVbxyl8Ba",\
          "name": "Item Photo"\
        },\
...\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Copy

### Adding a row to the table

Let us now look into how to create a new record (also known
as a row) in the table _Receipt Log_. The definition of
the table is shown below (truncated to show only important
details).

```json
{
  "name": "Receipt Log",
  "fields": [\
    {\
      "type": "singleLineText",\
      "name": "Short Description"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "multipleAttachments",\
      "name": "Item Photo"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "multipleAttachments",\
      "name": "Receipt Photo"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "dateTime",\
      "name": "Date & Time"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "currency",\
      "name": "Total"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "singleSelect",\
      "name": "Category"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "singleSelect",\
      "name": "Who Paid?"\
    },\
    {\
      "type": "multilineText",\
      "name": "Notes"\
    }\
  ],
}
```

Copy

We see that the fields _Item Photo_ and _Receipt_
_Photo_ are of type _multipleAttachments_. We will
update these fields along with the field _Short_
_Description_ which is of type _singleLineText_.

Airtable requires that one or more publicly accessible URLs
be specified for a field of
type _multipleAttachments_. Airtable downloads the
contents of the URLs into this field when the field is
added. So we need to upload the files to another service (such
as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) for
image files) where the URL is publicly accessible, and then
provide these URLs to Airtable when we create the record. A
bit of a roundabout compared to directly uploading files from
the hard disk, but that is what Airtable requires.

And here are the links to a sample _Item photo_
and _Receipt Photo_ that we will use.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oXA8Q6C.jpeg)

Item Photo

![](https://i.imgur.com/zls0l7r.jpeg)

Receipt Photo

We will use a value of _`Burrito meal at Burrito_
_bar`_ for the field _Short Description._ The
data required to be POSTed to create the record looks like
this:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "Short Description": "Burrito meal at Burrito bar",
    "Item Photo": [\
      {\
        "url": "https://i.imgur.com/oXA8Q6C.jpeg",\
        "filename": "bold-flavors-big-taste.jpg"\
      }\
    ],
    "Receipt Photo": [\
      {\
        "url": "https://i.imgur.com/zls0l7r.jpeg",\
        "filename": "CustomLogoReceipt4.jpg"\
      }\
    ]
  }
}
```

Copy

Note that each _multipleAttachments_ field needs an
array of a objects containing, at the minimum, a _url_
field. In addition, we have also specified the _filename_
field.

The call to create a record now looks like this:

```python
baseId = bases["bases"][0]["id"]
tableId = tables['tables'][0]['id']
url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableId}'
resp = requests.post(url,headers={
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_TOKEN}'
}, json=fields)
resp.raise_for_status()
print(json.dumps(resp.json(), indent=2))
```

Copy

The response from Airtable to this call looks like
below. Note that Airtable has fetched and stored the data from
the URLs we specified and the _url_ field in the response
reflects that ( _URLs have been truncated_).

```json
{
  "id": "recOzyTlU7yQeHxCp",
  "createdTime": "2024-05-28T15:12:33.000Z",
  "fields": {
    "Short Description": "Burrito meal at Burrito bar",

            "width": 600,\
            "height": 400\
          }\
        }\
      }\
    ]
  }

### Conclusion

This article showed how to create a record in an Airbase
table, and how to upload a file into a field of
type _multipleAttachments_. While the process is fairly
straightforward, documentaion and examples on how to upload a
file to an Airbase field is lacking. This article addressed
this issue.
