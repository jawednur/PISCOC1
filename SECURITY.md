# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Multi-Platform Integration Ecosystem. All team members should follow these guidelines to maintain the security of the application and protect sensitive data.

## Credentials Management

- **Never** commit credentials to source control
- Use a password manager for team credential sharing
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use unique credentials for each environment (development, staging, production)
- Revoke credentials immediately when a team member leaves

## API Key Security

- Store API keys as environment variables, never in code
- Use environment-specific API keys for different deployments
- Implement API key rotation policies
- Set appropriate permissions and scopes for API keys
- Monitor API key usage for unusual patterns

## Environment Variables

- Use `.env` files for local development only
- Set environment variables through deployment platform interfaces
- Include only placeholder values in `.env.example`
- Validate required environment variables on application startup
- Consider using a secrets management service for production

## Database Security

- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement least privilege access for database users
- Enable SSL for database connections
- Regularly backup the database
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Never expose the database directly to the internet

## Authentication

- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Set secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Use short-lived JWT tokens when applicable
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Require strong passwords

## Input Validation

- Validate all input on both client and server
- Use Zod schemas for type validation
- Sanitize input that will be displayed to prevent XSS
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## HTTPS

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper TLS/SSL settings
- Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Keep certificates up to date

## Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions for deterministic builds
- Be cautious with third-party libraries
- Remove unused dependencies

## Error Handling

- Implement custom error handling
- Don't expose stack traces in production
- Log errors securely (no sensitive data in logs)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide user-friendly error messages without revealing system details

## Audit Logging

- Log security-relevant events
- Include timestamp, user, action, and result
- Protect log integrity
- Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

## Security Testing

- Perform regular security assessments
- Use automated security scanning tools
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Run penetration tests periodically
- Review code for security vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

- Have a documented incident response plan
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Have procedures for containment and recovery
- Document lessons learned

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. If you discover a security vulnerability, report it immediately through the proper channels.
